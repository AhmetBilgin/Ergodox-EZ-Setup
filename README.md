# Ergodox-EZ-Setup

This project is designed for the Ergodox EZ which uses the [qmk](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware)
firmware. 

## Context
My never ending quest to have the perfect keyboard layout.

## Current Layout
Please refer to my [keymap](https://github.com/agupta231/Ergodox-EZ-Setup/blob/master/keymap.pdf) to
see what the current layout of the keyboard is. To see the different revisions of the layout, please
see the releases section.
